This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


This project is the GUI for [goparent](https://github.com/sasimpson/goparent).  Right now it requires running goparent locally, so make sure that is setup before you run this.

Clone/fork-clone the repo then:

  npm install
  npm start

then it should be running.  the install should grab all the dependencies.  if i left any out let me know.

## ToDo:

- [ ] add multiple children to a user to track
- [ ] add registration form
- [ ] full convert to redux for state management instead of local state in most cases

## Thanks:

@github/parkedwards for helping me with the dodgy react and redux bits.
